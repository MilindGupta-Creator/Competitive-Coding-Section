This repo contains some good level questions from beginner to advanced. 
It is designed keeping in mind that everybody should be able to follow this and it covers 
questions from basic to higher level.

The problem here is either taken from LEETCODE OR GFG.Just search the filename you will be able to find it.

GOAL: The goal is to explain the questions with intuition and cover some pattern which you need to understand if you are seeing BS for the first time.


SOME INTRO
------------

Basically there are two searching algorithm namely,

1) Linear Search -> it basically means searching in an sequential fashion.  [TC -> O(N)]
2) Binary Search -> It can only be applied on sorted data.It divides the given data into two parts in each iteration and based on condition reduces the data sized to half of its original size and neglecting the half data.This is what it makes this algorithm so efficient
[TC -> log(N)].



HOW TO GET MOST OUT OF THIS REPO : Follow this repo from first question to last.As some questions are build from previous question approach
                                   and some are the same question just framed differently.
