Given two positive integers num1 and num2, the task is to find the sum of the two numbers on a 
12 hour clock rather than a number line.

Input
First line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. 
For each test case there will be single line containing two space seperated integers.
Output

Corresponding to each test case, print the sum in a new line.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
0 <= num1 <= 50
0 <= num2 <= 50
Example:
Input:
2
7 5
3 5
Output
0
8
